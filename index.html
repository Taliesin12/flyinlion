      <h3>Our name was inspired by the Pi Xiu 貔貅, a mythological winged lion. The Pi Xiu was a servant who would fly out to retrieve treasures for their masters. Our digital marketing should feel like your very own Pi Xiu—that’s our goal. And we plan to do this through the power of authenticity.
        Here at Flyin Lion we offer a unique digital marketing experience with the aid of virtual reality and aerial views. We currently specialize in Matterport Scans and drone services.
