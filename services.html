        <h4>WHAT IS MATTERPORT?</h4>
          <p>Matterport is a 3D camera, which takes 360 degree still images that are then stitched together, creating a virtual tour. Our virtual reality, also known as professional high dynamic range (HDR) photographs, are as visually authentic as being somewhere in person, but of course with the effortlessness and ease this digital age provides. These virtual tours are not the wanna be slide shows or still shots with voice descriptions. This is the real deal. You can look up, down and all around as you walk throughout the entirety of the scanned space, giving customers complete confidence with our authentic views.<br> <br>Potential home buyers can easily access this “always open-house” to see the layout of the home and fine details of each room. <br> <br>Potential customers can see the aesthetics of an event center, and learn their way around the building before ever arriving. <br> <br>Even hotel guests, when deciding on which room to book, can see the sizes and features of each room model with accuracy. <br><br> A picture is worth a thousand words. The worth of a virtual tour—well, let us prove what it can do for you and your business.
